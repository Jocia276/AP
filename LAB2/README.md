Write a program that:

1. Display all leap years between two given years (including given years).

* Main function: get_leap_years(start: int, end: int) -> list[int]
* Test function: test_get_leap_years()

2.Returns all perfect squares in a given closed interval.

* Main function: get_perfect_squares(start: int, end: int) -> list[int]
* Test function: test_get_perfect_squares()

3. Converts a given temperature in a given scale (K, F or C) to another given scale. For example: 300 K C -> 26.85.

* Main function: get_temp(temp: float, from: str, to: str) -> float
* Test function: test_get_temp()

Functions must have the names given in the statement and be specified.
You must have a user interface that allows data to be entered until a command is entered that stops the application. The application will only stop when the user wants it to. You do not need to validate the data read from the user.
